# Scripts

There are several scripts in the `scripts` folder used to populate the database with upcoming events. It is necessary to create a `.env` file in the root folder of the backend for them to work correctly. Use the `.env-sample` file to help you set the necessary environment variables.

# Getting started

If you want to run the whole script, just run the following command on the root directory:

```bash
python3.10 saveProcessedPosts.py
```
