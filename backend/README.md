# Getting started

This folder contains the backend side of the project. It is developed in `python 3.10`.
You can install it and the necessary dependencies running the `initialize` script:

```bash
bash initialize.sh
```

# Running the server

You can start the server locally by running the following command on the root directory:

```bash
bash runServer.sh <server_port>
```

The server will run on port 9000 by default if you don't provide any `server_port`.
