# Getting started

This folder contains the backend side of the project. It is developed in `python 3.10`.
You can install it and the necessary dependencies running the `initialize` script:

```bash
bash initialize.sh
```

# Running the server

You can start the server locally by running the following command on the root directory:

```bash
python3.10 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:9000
```

This is telling it to run on port 9000, but you can choose whatever port you prefer.
